# FloatingLabels
EditText Floating Labels: Android design support library


The new TextInputLayout allows us to wrap EditText views in order to display floating labels above the EditText field. This layout also let show error messages below the EditText field. When an EditText has focus, the assigned hint will ‘float’ above the view to the top-left hand side.
